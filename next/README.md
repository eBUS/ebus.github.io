# Description

The source files are taken from the commit associated with the submodule `ebusd-configuration-next` (watch the "-next" suffix!) in [this repository](https://github.com/eBUS/ebus.github.io) and the mapping from those to the generated CSV files is also re-generated with each update and [documented here](mapping.md).
